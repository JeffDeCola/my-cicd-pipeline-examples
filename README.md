## CONCOURSE PIPELINES

* [concourse-pipeline-simple-example](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cicd-pipeline-examples/tree/master/concourse-pipelines/concourse-pipeline-simple-example)

  _A simple concourse pipeline using just a pipeline.yml file._

* [concourse-pipeline-example](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cicd-pipeline-examples/tree/master/concourse-pipelines/concourse-pipeline-example)
